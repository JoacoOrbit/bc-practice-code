# Practice Code
---
## What is this?
In this repository I will upload the code of minor practices from a bootcamp i'm participating on.
## Objective
My objective is to get used to GitHub and also have all my practice code organized.
## What can you expect?
The bootcamp is focused in **web development** with a focus on **springboot**.
Here I will upload really simple code used for practicing concepts of:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Web Development
- Java
- Spring Boot
## What not to expect?
graded assignments, small standalone projects, personal projects or projects for the bootcamp, all of these would have a separate repository.
